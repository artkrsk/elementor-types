# Description: Restructure common utilities, base classes, and configuration interfaces to match Elementor's core structure
# Details:
Create src/common/ directory with utils/, helpers/, and config/ subdirectories. Implement device detection utilities, DOM manipulation helpers, environment detection, global configuration interfaces, and shared type guards that mirror Elementor's common utilities.
