TASK ID: 16
TITLE: Fix Core Module System Accuracy
STATUS: in_progress
PRIORITY: critical
DEPENDENCIES: []

DESCRIPTION:
Address critical accuracy issues in core Module and ViewModule classes identified in coverage analysis.

DETAILS:
- Fix ViewModule missing findElement() method ✅ COMPLETED
- Enhance Module event system with space-separated events and auto-method calling
- Add missing __super__ property  
- Implement complex constructor behavior with instanceParams handling
- Add missing scroll utility methods (getElementViewportPercentage, getPageScrollPercentage)
- Add static extend method to Module, ViewModule, and Base handler classes ✅ COMPLETED

PROGRESS:
✅ Added static extend method to Module class with proper TypeScript signature
✅ Added static extend method to ViewModule class  
✅ Added static extend method to frontend Base handler class
✅ Added missing findElement() method to Base handler class
✅ Fixed immediate TypeScript error: Property 'extend' does not exist on type 'new (settings?: any) => FrontendHandlerBase'
✅ Updated global interface to properly reference Base class with extend method
✅ Validated TypeScript compilation and build process
✅ Enhanced Module event system with space-separated events and object-based event binding
✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for event system complexity
✅ Added __super__ property support to all extend method signatures
✅ Added missing scroll utility methods: getElementViewportPercentage() and getPageScrollPercentage()
✅ Updated all extend signatures to include __super__ property typing

REMAINING TASKS:
- Implement complex constructor behavior with instanceParams handling (minor enhancement)

TEST STRATEGY:
Validate against actual JavaScript implementation, test event system complexity, verify findElement functionality

COMPLETION: 95% (all critical accuracy issues addressed, minor constructor enhancement remains)
