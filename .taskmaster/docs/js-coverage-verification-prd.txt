# Elementor JS Codebase Coverage Verification

## Objective
Verify that our refactored TypeScript types provide 100% coverage of the original Elementor JavaScript codebase in `./elementor-dev-js`, ensuring all classes, modules, methods, and APIs are properly typed.

## Verification Approach

### 1. Core Module System Coverage
Analyze `elementor-dev-js/modules/` and verify our `src/core/` types cover:
- Module base classes
- ViewModule implementations  
- Component lifecycle methods
- Module registration and dependency system

### 2. Frontend Coverage Analysis
Compare `elementor-dev-js/frontend/` with our `src/frontend/` types:
- Main frontend class and configuration
- Element handlers system
- Documents manager
- Frontend utilities and tools

### 3. Editor Coverage Analysis  
Compare `elementor-dev-js/editor/` with our `src/editor/` types:
- Editor main class and document handling
- Command system ($e namespace)
- Control system and all control types
- Component system and views
- Container system

### 4. Admin Coverage Analysis
Compare `elementor-dev-js/admin/` with our `src/admin/` types:
- Admin main class
- Beta tester functionality  
- Floating elements
- New template system
- Menu handlers

### 5. Handlers System Coverage
Analyze `elementor-dev-js/frontend/handlers/` and verify our handler types:
- Base handler classes
- Widget-specific handlers
- Element handlers (section, column, container)
- Swiper-based handlers

### 6. Controls System Coverage
Deep analysis of `elementor-dev-js/editor/controls/` vs our control types:
- All control base classes
- Specific control implementations
- Control behaviors and validation
- Responsive and global settings

### 7. Utilities Coverage
Compare utility files and ensure our `src/utils/` covers:
- Hooks system
- Events system  
- Breakpoints handling
- Helper functions

### 8. Integration and Missing Types
Identify any gaps and create missing type definitions for complete coverage.

## Success Criteria
- Every JS class has corresponding TypeScript interface/class
- All public methods and properties are typed
- All configuration objects are properly defined
- No missing APIs or functionality
- 100% coverage of original codebase
