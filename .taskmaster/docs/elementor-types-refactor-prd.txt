# Elementor Types Library Refactoring Project

## Project Overview

Refactor the monolithic Elementor Types library from a single 3000+ line file into a well-organized, modular TypeScript package with clear separation of concerns and improved developer experience.

## Current State

- Single monolithic file (src/types.ts) containing all type definitions (~3000+ lines)
- Mixed concerns: Frontend, editor, admin, and core types all in one file
- Unclear exports making it difficult for developers to know what to import
- Missing documentation and usage examples
- Hard to navigate and maintain

## Goals

1. **Modular Structure**: Split types into logical, domain-specific modules
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Clear exports and improved IntelliSense
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to find, update, and extend types
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API while introducing new structure
5. **Documentation**: Clear usage examples and migration guide

## Technical Requirements

### Core Infrastructure
- Maintain TypeScript compilation targets (ES2020, ESNext)
- Preserve all existing type definitions
- Ensure no breaking changes in v2.0 release
- Support both named and namespace exports

### Module Organization
- Core module system (Module, ViewModule, ArgsObject classes)
- Frontend types (handlers, config, utilities)
- Editor types (components, controls, commands)
- Admin types (admin-specific interfaces)
- Shared utilities (hooks, events, breakpoints)
- Third-party integrations (Swiper, jQuery)
- Global declarations (Window interface augmentations)

### Export Strategy
- Named exports for selective imports
- Namespace exports for grouped functionality
- Type-only exports where appropriate
- Backward compatibility layer maintaining current import paths

## Deliverables

### Phase 1: Structure Setup
- Create new directory structure
- Set up barrel exports (index.ts files)
- Maintain existing types.ts temporarily

### Phase 2: Type Extraction
- Extract core module system types
- Separate frontend types into dedicated modules
- Organize editor types by functionality
- Create utility type modules

### Phase 3: Export Strategy
- Create comprehensive index.ts with multiple export patterns
- Add helper types and type guards
- Implement backward compatibility layer

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to key interfaces
- Create usage examples for common scenarios
- Write migration guide from v1 to v2

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- Ensure TypeScript compilation works
- Validate all imports resolve correctly
- Test backward compatibility
- Verify IntelliSense improvements

## Success Criteria

1. All existing imports continue to work without changes
2. New modular imports provide better IntelliSense
3. Bundle size can be reduced through selective imports
4. Code organization is logical and intuitive
5. Documentation clearly explains usage patterns
6. Migration path is straightforward and well-documented

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain TypeScript 4.9+ compatibility
- Cannot break existing consumer code
- Must preserve all current type definitions
- Should follow existing code style and patterns
- Must work with current build tools and processes

## Future Considerations

- v3.0 can remove backward compatibility layer
- Potential for independent versioning of modules
- Extensibility for new Elementor features
- Integration with Elementor plugin development tools
